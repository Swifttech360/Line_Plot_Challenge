Program: Line Plot Challenge
AUTHOR: Miles Butler
Date: 1/26/2025
Overview:
This program has two stages. First, the program allows the user to plot points on a 4x4 graph by typing two numbers
(1-4) seperated by a space. These points can also be removed by entering the same coordinate again. The user can then
enter "next" or "break" to begin the second stage of the program.

In the second stage of the program, the user can begin entering points to check if they form a line of connected
points of the same value (1 or 0) based on the graph they made previously. Uppon entering a point that breaks this
line of points, the program will notify the user, and explain exactly why the line of checked points are no longer
connected.
